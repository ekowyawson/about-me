    <p>
      My name is Ekow (pronounced "echo") and I am a highly skilled professional software developer with extensive experience in full-stack web development, application development, and engineering of dev systems and tools. Proficient in JavaScript, Python, BASH scripting, and SQL. I currently reside in Maryland, close to Baltimore: home of the best seafood in America. Tinkering and solving complex problems is my most cherished past-time, which has translated well into my IT career. I've also built a few websites and web applications using different frameworks, primarily MERN. My goal in this course (and subsequent courses here at Code Fellows) is to merge my raw skills with the institutional knowledge required to be a fully qualified developer.
